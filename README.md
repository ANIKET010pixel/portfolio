# Plant Disease Detection Using Deep Learning and Explainable AI (XAI)
📌 **Overview:** Developed a deep learning model to autonomously detect plant diseases from leaf images using Explainable AI (XAI) with LIME.
- **Utilized deep learning techniques** to train the model on a dataset of 2000 augmented images of Custard Apple leaves.
- **Implemented LIME** for manual filtration of the dataset to enhance accuracy and interpretability, achieving 94% accuracy (an improvement of 20%-22%).
- **Enabled explainable predictions** by identifying key areas in images crucial for disease detection, improving model transparency and revealing dataset biases.
- **Deployed the model** through a web application using Flask, allowing users to upload plant images and receive accurate disease diagnoses and treatment recommendations.
