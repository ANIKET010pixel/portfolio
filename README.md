### 📊 Netflix Business Case Study 
📌 **Overview:** Conducted a comprehensive analysis of Netflix’s content library to identify trends in movie and TV show distribution, genre preferences, and geographical variations, providing actionable business insights and recommendations.

- Analyzed a dataset containing Netflix’s global content to identify the shift from movies to TV shows, observing that TV shows surpassed movies in 2020.
- Explored genre preferences across different countries, revealing that international movies, dramas, and comedies dominate Netflix's global library, while some countries have very specific content preferences.
- Conducted detailed analysis on Netflix's ratings distribution, showing that most content is targeted at mature audiences (TV-MA), with limited availability for children’s content in many regions.
- Provided actionable business insights, including recommendations for expanding country-specific genres, improving the content mix for underrepresented age groups, and addressing regional gaps in content.
- Developed visualizations to represent content distribution, genre preferences, and geographical trends, helping stakeholders understand Netflix’s content dynamics and make informed decisions.

📊 Key Findings:
- **Content Distribution**: Around 70% of Netflix content is Movies and around 30% is TV Shows.
- **Yearly Content Uploads**: A surge in content uploads began in 2015, with 2019 marking the highest number of uploads. A drop in content was observed in 2020 and 2021, likely due to the pandemic.
- **Global Content**: Netflix hosts content from 122 countries, with the United States contributing almost 37% of the total content.
- **Genres**: International Movies and TV Shows, Dramas, and Comedies are the top 3 genres across both Movies and TV Shows.
- **Ratings**: The majority of content is rated TV-MA, targeting mature audiences. Countries like the US have a wider variety of ratings, while other countries have very limited ratings for children.

### Plant Disease Detection Using Deep Learning and Explainable AI (XAI)
📌 **Overview:** Developed a deep learning model to autonomously detect plant diseases from leaf images using Explainable AI (XAI) with LIME.
- **Utilized deep learning techniques** to train the model on a dataset of 2000 augmented images of Custard Apple leaves.
- **Implemented LIME** for manual filtration of the dataset to enhance accuracy and interpretability, achieving 94% accuracy (an improvement of 20%-22%).
- **Enabled explainable predictions** by identifying key areas in images crucial for disease detection, improving model transparency and revealing dataset biases.
- **Deployed the model** through a web application using Flask, allowing users to upload plant images and receive accurate disease diagnoses and treatment recommendations.
